{"name":"D3po","tagline":"Python interface for creating plots with NVD3.js","body":"d3po\r\n====\r\n\r\nYet another Javascript library for making d3 charts. After playing with\r\n[nvd3](http://nvd3.org) I found it wasn't quite as usable as I would like,\r\ne.g. it wasn't very easy to add both points and lines to the same chart.\r\nThis library works as follows:\r\n\r\n    var chart = d3po.chart();\r\n    chart.lines([{x:0,y:3},{x:2,y:5}],{stroke:'blue'}])\r\n    chart.scatter([{x:0,y:3.1,size:3,fill:'blue'},{x:0.5,y:2.5,size:5,fill:'red'}]);\r\n\r\nI wanted a charting library that 'just works', like those you find in R or python.\r\nFlexible where it needs to be, unobtrusive API that is amenable to embedding\r\nin other settings (e.g. [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)),\r\nwith helpful interactivity.\r\n\r\n[Examples](http://adamlabadorf.github.io/src/d3po/src/test.html)\r\n\r\n[IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/adamlabadorf.github.io/src/d3po/src/d3po.ipynb)\r\n\r\nd3pyo\r\n-----\r\n\r\nd3pyo is a python wrapper for generating d3po charts. I wrote it so I could put\r\nd3po charts into ipython notebooks. You can use it like this (in an ipython notebook\r\nblock, last line has to be the HTML call):\r\n\r\n    from random import random\r\n    import urllib2\r\n    from IPython.display import HTML\r\n    exec urllib2.urlopen('http://adamlabadorf.github.io/src/d3po/src/d3pyo.py').read()\r\n    # this initializes d3po and its dependencies, put before other calls\r\n    HTML(d3po_init())\r\n\r\n    # in a different box\r\n    c = Chart({'name':'awesome_interactive_chart'})\r\n    c.scatter([dict(x=random(),y=random(),size=random()) for _ in range(10)])\r\n    HTML(c.js)\r\n\r\nThe python `Chart` class has all of the same methods exposed as the functions on the\r\n`d3po.chart` object.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\n[jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [d3](http://d3js.org).\r\n\r\nWork in progress\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nImplemented:\r\n\r\n    - scatter\r\n    - lines\r\n    - boxes (heatmap primitive, bar charts)\r\n    - heatmap\r\n    - axes\r\n    - tooltips on hover over points\r\n    - d3 zoom behavior (can be turned off)\r\n    - html-based controls\r\n\r\nStill lots of features to implement:\r\n\r\n    - boxplots\r\n    - search feature\r\n    - documentation (nvd3 is pretty bad about this as of this writing)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
